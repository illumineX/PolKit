**PolKit is a collection of many reusable Obj-C classes and functions for Mac OS X Leopard and later providing features like advanced networking, file system utilities, HID, MIDI & serial port devices support, OpenSSL encryption, file upload & download for many protocols, etc...**

The code is clean, ready to be used in your project, self-documented and has unit tests. Most classes are also independent from each other, so you can just pick what you need.

The entire project is available open-source under GPLv3 license.
